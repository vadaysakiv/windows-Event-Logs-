"calc.exe", originally located in System32, should not be found in a writable directory. Therefore, a copy of "calc.exe" in a writable directory serves as an IOC, as it should always reside in System32 or potentially Syswow64.

"WININET.dll", originally located in System32, should not be loaded outside of System32 by calc.exe. If instances of "WININET.dll" loading occur outside of System32 with "calc.exe" as the parent process, it indicates a DLL hijack within calc.exe. While caution is necessary when alerting on all instances of "WININET.dll" loading outside of System32 (as some applications may package specific DLL versions for stability), in the case of "calc.exe", we can confidently assert a hijack due to the DLL's unchanging name, which attackers cannot modify to evade detection.

The original "WININET.dll" is Microsoft-signed, while our injected DLL remains unsigned.
